01/02/19:
Worked on the design document and planned out how we were going to tackle this project. Created the repository.

01/04/19:
Built the map that would be needed to help the tree burning algorithm function.
Made the trees randomly generate.

01/06/19:
First attempt at making the algorithm for spreading fires using the frontier based method.

01/07/19:
Fixed some bugs with the frontier based method and changed the formatting of test
printing the map.

01/08/19:
Repaired essential bugs that were not noticed before. Made the algorithm work correctly.
Added the system of selecting which methods of calculating the user wants to use.

01/09/19:
Added user input on the density and dimensions of the forest when making simulations.

01/10/19:
Created non-frontier method of burning forests. Fixed the simulation algorithms again
so that they match in results.

01/11/19:
Added forking to the simulations so that multiple cores or threads can be used at once.

01/12/19:
Added error checking with the input as well as beautifying a lot of code and made
text-interaction more intuitive and simple. Did a lot of minor fixes in code/beautifying.

01/14/19: - 01/15/19
Made the breakthrough between implementing server input and making clients do work. This was
done through switching read/write loops in the forking server and the client. We were stuck
before this breakthrough on how to actually implement servers. I worked on client.c while Jason
worked on forking server. We voice chatted and discussed the whole process, from comma separated
inputs to parsers and then feeding it in/out of the buffer in order to feed it into our calculate methods.
We worked very well.

01/15/19 (morning)
Added graphs to display data and did minor bug fixes to ensure that user has best experience and that
demo doesn't mess up.
